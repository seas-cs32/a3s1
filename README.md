This directory contains everything you need as a student for Act III,
Scene I (Types and Tools).

The following files are used in **Problem #14 (Build an annotator)**:

`my_pdb0.py`: Script that inserts a breakpoint into an input script and
writes out the new script.

`my_pdb1.py`: Extends `my_pdb1.py` to launch the edited script.

`my_pdb.py`: Turns `my_pdb1.py` into an instrumentation program.

`my_repl.py`: Turns `my_pdb.py` into a script that inserts a read-execute-print loop
at the breakpoint location.

script for our baby Python debuggers and instrumentation scripts.
