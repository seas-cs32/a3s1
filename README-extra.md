Here are extra files beyond those described in `README.md`.

The following files are related to **Problem #15 (Types and pointers)**:

`types-*.py`: Scripts that illustrate how to use Python type annotations, why
typing changes the way you think about variables, and when type information can
really help.  The order of presentation is `none` then `anno` then `choices` and
then `useful`.
